# Work-under-Data-Visualization

<h2>Python Version - 3.5<h2>

<h3>To run the python script(brainpan_task1.py), there are some modules required.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Matplotlib 2.0.0</li>
<li>Numpy 1.12.0</li>
<li>Basemap 1.0.8(http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#basemap)</li>
<li>tkinter</li>
<li>csv</li>
</ul>
<h3>Note - Keep the .csv file and script in same folder.<h3>

<h3>The reason for choosing these five visualization techniques are-</h3>
<ul>
<li>Technique 1 - This specific Pie Chart of a country helps to compare the spread of the disease in terms of affected cities in a country.</li>
<li>Technique 2 - Bar Chart representing top 20 most spread Diseases helps to observe and compare the number of countries affected by a disease.</li>
<li>Technique 3 - This Stacked Column Chart shows number of cases of specific disease happened and number of deaths due to that disease.</li>
<li>Technique 4 – This technique provides a quick way to observe the affected countries due to a specific disease and relate a disease to the climate pattern of the world, status of development of the country.</li>
<li>Technique 5 – This bubble chart show the variation of three variables – rating, number of Diseases of that rating and number of countries affected due to these diseases. We can observe that the diseases of rating 3 are maximum in number and which have also affected maximum number of countries.</li>
</ul>
<h3>My understanding from the data are-</h3>
I observed that diseases which are communicable have more number of cases in overpopulated countries as compared to less populated countries. For example Dengue, Chikungunya, Influenza. Some diseases with maximum death cases are Influenza H1N1, HIV/AIDS and also these diseases have caused deaths in countries with weak medical facilities.
Diseases like Influenza have more number of cases in countries with severe winter climate. These have very less cases in countries near equator. Diseases like Dengue, Malaria, Chikungunya have affected those countries which don’t have a clean environment.
